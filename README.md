# Rock,Paper,Scisor
 is a children's game, a game of hands in which there are three elements: the rock that beats the scissors by breaking it, the scissors that beats the paper by cutting it and the paper that beats the stone by wrapping it
# Rules
A "Rock, paper or scissors" is played two by two. The players must face each other with one hand behind their back and say out loud: rock, paper or scissors, just at the end of the sentence they will show their hands and see who wins. If the two players get the same figure there is a tie, a draw, no one wins.
